# PowerShellScripting
My repository for learning PowerShell and creating scripts for work, home and fun!

## Outline
This repsitory is structured as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>License - open source, for everyone, for ever.</li>
        <li>Readme - to help you out.</li>
        <li>Notes - to help me learn.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>These notes are a living document to help with my learning of PowerShell and Scripting. They are intended for no other audience than myself and as such, may be of little benefit to others. I find that taking notes while I study keeps me focussed and provides handy reference when memory fails. The combination of Notion for html-structured note creation and GitHub for easy access is a powerful combination, and one that I would recommend to anyone on a similar learning journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Scripts - the good stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    
Enjoy...
